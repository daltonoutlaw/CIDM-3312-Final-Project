## CIDM 3312 Final Project
# For the final project you will create an ASP.NET Core application using EF Core. You will combine all the skills and technologies learned throughout this class into one complete web application. Your task is to develop an idea for a web application that requires data storage and management, and implement it using ASP.NET and EF Core with the following requirements:
(DONE)• You will create your own GitHub repository. There is no GitHub Classroom link.
o Make your repo Public so I can view it.
o Create a .gitignore file that contains “bin/” and “obj/”.
(DONE)• Your web application should have at least TWO database tables implemented as entity classes.
(DONE)• Follow steps 1-8 from Week 9 to create your ASP.NET Core project with EF Core.
(DONE)• You can use scaffolding for step 8 if you like, but it is not required.
o If you scaffold, pick one entity class to scaffold.
o If you do not scaffold, write your own CRUD pages for one of the entity classes.
(DONE)• Whether you scaffold or not, you must manually create razor pages to connect related data.
o For example, if you have students and courses the course page should list the students
in the course. Each student page should list the courses that student is in.
o Another example would be to have a button or form for a student to add/drop a course.
(DONE)• To connect related data, create or edit existing razor pages to do the following:
o Display or list the data in a 2nd entity class alongside the first.
o Create or add a new record of the 2nd entity class.
o Update or modify an existing record in the 2nd entity class.
o Delete a record from the 2nd entity class.
(DONE)• Create a “Bootstrap Home Page” razor page and page model. Use at least two Bootstrap
capabilities (cards, carousels, new Bootstrap Theme, Icons, tables, forms) to build a home page
that presents your project to the world in a professional way. This will be like Homework 6.
(DONE)• Seed the database with records for all your entities. Ensure that one entity has enough records
(at least 25) to support paging.
(DONE)• Add Data Validation to all the necessary properties.
(DONE)• Add paging support to a razor page. For example, list only ten records at a time and allow the
user to navigate to the next and previous pages. Disable the next/prev buttons as appropriate.
(DONE)• Add a search bar to at least one razor page. Allow the user to type in a search string and show
only those results.
(DONE)• Allow the user to sort on at least one record both ascending and descending.
(DONE)• Add links to all appropriate pages in the navigation bar.
